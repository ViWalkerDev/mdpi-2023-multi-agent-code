# mdpi-2023-multi-agent-code

This is a repo for storing and providing the raw code produced by the last paper of my doctoral thesis. The code is functional but currently poorly commented and is not currently documented. This is provided as is. More details for using this code will hopefully be provided on the main nanomap repo page under the corresponding branch. This messy 'as-is' access is provided in the meantime.
